Publishing
==========

Flatpak provides several ways to distribute applications. The primary method is to host a repository. This is relatively simple (although there are some important details to be aware of) and allows application updates to be distributed.

It is also possible to distribute Flatpaks as single file bundles, which can be useful in some situations.
