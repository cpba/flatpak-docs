Publishing
==========

Flatpak provides several ways to distribute applications to users. For many applications, the most convenient and effective method is to use `Flathub <https://flathub.com>`_, which provides a large centralized repository of Flatpak applications.

Alternatively, it is possible to host a repository yourself, or to distribute Flatpaks as single file bundles.
